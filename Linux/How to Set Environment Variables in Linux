How to Set Environment Variables in Linux
	
Setting an Environment Variable
	To set an environment variable the export command is used.
	We give the variable a name, which is what is used to access it in shell scripts and configurations,
	and then a value to hold whatever data is needed in the variable.
		export NAME=VALUE
	
	For example,
	to set the environment variable for the home directory of a manual OpenJDK 11 installation,
	we would use something similar to the following.
		export JAVA_HOME=/opt/openjdk11
	
	To output the value of the environment variable from the shell, 
	we use the echo command and prepend the variable’s name with a dollar ($) sign.	
		echo $JAVA_HOME
		
		
Unsetting an Environment Variable
	unset VARIABLE_NAME

Persisting Environment Variables for a User
	When an environment variable is set from the shell using the export command, its existence ends when the user’s sessions ends. This is problematic when we need the variable to persist across sessions.
	1. Open the current user’s profile into a text editor
		vi ~/.bash_profile
	2. Add the export command for every environment variable you want to persist.
		export JAVA_HOME=/opt/openjdk11
		
	Adding the environment variable to a user’s bash profile alone will not export it automatically. However, the variable will be exported the next time the user logs in.
	To immediately apply all changes to bash_profile, use the source command.
		source ~/.bash_profile

Setting Persistent Global Environment Variables
	When an environment variable needs to persist globally across the entire system, we can set it in the default profile loaded by all users on the system.
	All global profile settings are stored under /etc/profile. And while this file can be edited directory, it is actually recommended to store global environment variables in a directory named /etc/profile.d, where you will find a list of files that are used to set environment variables for the entire system.
	1. Create a new file under /etc/profile.d to store the global environment variable(s). The name of the should be contextual so others may understand its purpose.
		sudo touch /etc/profile.d/http_proxy.sh
	2. Open the default profile into a text editor.
		sudo vi /etc/profile.d/http_proxy.sh
	3. 	Add new lines to export the environment variables
		export HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy:8080
		export HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy:8080
		export NO_PROXY=localhost,::1,.example.com
	4. 	Save your changes and exit the text editor
